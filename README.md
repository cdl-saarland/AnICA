TODO write this

## TODO

### Key Functionality
  - [ ] implement mechanism for dropping constraints
  - [ ] implement the core generalization algorithm

### Functional Extensions
  - [ ] check whether using an SMT solver for subsumption is necessary and reasonable
  - [ ] look into sampling constraint solvers if sampling turns out to be an issue
  - [ ] add more predictors
    - [ ] Ithemal
    - [ ] DiffTune
    - [ ] OSACA
    - [ ] CQA?
    - [ ] measurements

### Meta Features
  - [ ] improve database scheme to make comparing measurements faster
  - [ ] make sampling deterministic (for the same seed)
  - [ ] profile running times of the components and check for bottlenecks
  - [ ] write this README
  - [ ] document everything
